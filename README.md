# quake-rs
A Rust re-implementation of Handmade Quake. 

## Goals
* Multiplatform: I would love this to run on Windows 7+ and Linux. I don't have a Mac OS device, so I won't be able to test there.
* Idiomatic Rust, preserving the broad strokes of the original implementation. 
* As little unsafe code as possible, ideally none.

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome. I'll try to keep up with the progress of the videos on a week-to-week basis, but I can't guarantee
I'll always have enough time.
